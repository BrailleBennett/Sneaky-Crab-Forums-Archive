			<content:encoded><![CDATA[We’ve decided to close the Timecrest forums, and will do so on July 1, 2023. Please archive any discussion or media posted before that date.<br />
<br />
Make sure to collect your Time Crystals for joining the forums before July 1, as the feature will not be available after this date. In the Timecrest app, open the Pocket Watch, go to Relationships, and scroll down and select forums. This reward is only available once per user.<br />
<br />
We launched the Timecrest forums in 2015 as a way to bring our community together. We have had incredible discussion, fan art, theories, and fan fiction. We want to thank Ben Rose and ChristineMoon, our highly active and involved forum moderators that were critical to making the forums a success. They launched the first Timecrest trivia that was so deep and fun, even we were sometimes stumped by the questions!<br />
<br />
We continue to evolve with our community, and nowadays actively gather and interact on Twitter, Facebook, and Discord. Please join us there, and the links to join our community are always available in the Relationships screen of the Pocket Watch.<br />
